# Traffic
 
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic before the pandemic and during the pandemic. The question we seek to answer is if there is a significance difference in traffic between the two periods. For this, the traffic data during January 2019 and January 2020 was used, alongside computer vision methods for traffic detection.
